## üåå Project Overview

The **NEO Tracker** is a modern web application designed to track and visualize data about Near-Earth Objects (NEOs), such as asteroids and comets. Built as a hands-on project to demonstrate modern web development and DevOps practices, this application provides users with powerful tools to explore celestial data. It's built with a focus on a clean, professional user interface, robust data handling, and is structured for easy deployment.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Dynamic Dashboard**: A real-time dashboard displaying key statistics about NEOs, including the total number of asteroids, potentially hazardous objects, and other critical metrics.

* **Search Functionality**: Users can search for asteroids within a specific 7-day date range, retrieving a list of objects that were tracked during that period.

* **Real-Time Data**: A dedicated "Real-Time" tab that fetches and displays the most current asteroid data for the present day.

* **Asteroid Lookup**: A lookup feature that allows users to search for a specific asteroid by its unique NASA JPL ID and view its complete details.

* **Detailed Information**: Clicking on any asteroid provides a comprehensive view of its physical properties, orbital data, and close approach details.

* **Persistent Search History**: The application saves the last five search queries to local storage, allowing for quick and convenient access to previous searches.

* **Professional UI/UX**: The user interface is built with **React** and styled using **Tailwind CSS**, providing a responsive and visually appealing experience across all devices.

## üöÄ Technology Stack

* **Frontend**: React (with Vite)

* **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, Lucide React (for icons)

* **Data Visualization**: Recharts for charts and graphs

* **API**: NASA's Near-Earth Object Web Service (NeoWs) API

* **State Management**: React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
